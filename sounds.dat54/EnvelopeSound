The EnvelopeSound (_env, _envelope, _one_shot) type is used to apply an ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) style envelope to a sound. 

Envelopes are used to play a sound for a specific duration and with specific mounts of fade-in/out.

The EnvelopeSound uses the additional variable Hold (ADSHR), which defines the amount of time sustain occurs.

Fields:

	0 = Volume
	1 = Pitch
	2 = Pan
	3 = LPF
	4 = HPF
	5 = Variable (uses OutputVariable field)
	6 = Logarithmic LPF
	7 = Logarithmic HPF

OuputRangeMin      float             -100                   Ouput level min (controls minimum envelope scale)
OuputRangeMax      float             0                      Ouput level max (controls maximum envelope scale)

Example:

"truck_horn" will have 900 ms of attack time (Volume from 0 to 100%) before releasing for a further 200 ms.

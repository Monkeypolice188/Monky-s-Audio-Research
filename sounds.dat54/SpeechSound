The SpeechSound is used to play randomised sounds directly from the .awc file. 

The type is typically used for, but not limited to, speech, ambience, pain and oneshot sounds.

It essentially pulls a specific entry (or entries) from speech .awcs, and is designed to work much more quickly with these sounds.

Fields:

LastVariation - integer value - Unknown //min number of variations for this speech entry?
SpeechUnkInt1 - integer value - Unknown //max number of variations for this speech entry?
VoiceName - metahash - name of base ByteArray entry in speech.dat
ContextName - metahash - context name - the name of the sound context in the .awc name in ALL CAPS (without value suffix, e.g., _01)

Example:

<Item type="SpeechSound">
 <Name>vb_female_01</Name>
 <Header>
  <Flags value="0x00000004" />
  <Unk02 value="65236" />
 </Header>
 <LastVariation value="1" />
 <SpeechUnkInt1 value="1" />
 <VoiceName>vb_female_01</VoiceName>
 <ContextName>VB_ONESHOT</ContextName>
</Item>

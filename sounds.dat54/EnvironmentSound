The EnvironmentSound type is used to apply environmental reflections to a sound.

The sound type is used to refract and reflect sounds according to the player's position.

It is mostly used on vehicles to refract exhaust sounds, but is also used on radio emitters, bird ambience and stereo sounds.

It can also be used as a child of a ModularSynthSound which applies the refraction directly to the synth.

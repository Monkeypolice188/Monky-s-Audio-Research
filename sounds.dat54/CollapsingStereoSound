The CollapsingStereoSound (_css, _collapse) type is used to collapse a stereo's tracks into two singular mono tracks.

Two mono tracks defined as LeftSound and RightSound will only be played in stereo playback if the player is within a certain distance range.

The distance range is defined as a min/max range in meters. If the player exceeds the distance bounds, the sound will play one single mono track (LeftSound).

A crossfade curve will be applied during the fade between the mono and stereo playback.

Fields:

Field name                Type      FileRef Default value      Description
LeftSound                 metahash  dat54                      Stereo track 1 (left)
RightSound                metahash  dat54                      Stereo track 2 (right)
MinDistance               float             0                  Minimum distance in meters to play the track in stereo
MaxDistance               float                                Maximum distance in meters to play the track in stereo; after which it will reduce to mono playback
MinDistanceVariable       metahash                             Variable to use for MinDistance
MaxDistanceVariable       metahash                             Variable to use for MaxDistance
CrossfadeOverrideVariable metahash                             Variable to use to override the default Crossfade curve

	0 = Fixed
	1 = Both (plays both tracks as stereo)
	2 = Retrigger
	3 = Position-relative Pan

The "AutomationNoteMapSound" (_map, _notes) sound type is used to map sounds to an AutomationSound type, which uses a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) sound. 

The type can have numerous items which define specific note ranges of the MIDI, assigning them instruments or sounds individually.

The mapping will transpose the note range about middle C (C3).

It is important to note that the NoteRangeMin value will transpose the MIDI about middle C (C3 - note 48) according to the value you set it at. 
For example, if the minimum note of your preferred range is note 37, setting a value of 37 will transpose the tune by -11 semi-tones (37-48 = -11). 
To correct the resulting pitch change of transposing, the ChildSound should have an opposing pitch change value which should correspond with the number of semi-tones.
For example, a transpose of -11 semi-tones should = -1100 pitch value (or 64435) to cancel out the change in pitch.)

Example:

Below, "merry_christmas_01_map" has two mappings:
	- notes 0 to 60 (C1 to C4) are assigned a jingle sound. These do not change pitch regardless of the MIDI notes.
	- notes 61 to 128 (D4 to G10) are assigned an organ sound.

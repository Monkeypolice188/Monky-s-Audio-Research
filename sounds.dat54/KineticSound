The KineticSound (_kinetic) type is used to define information about kinetic-dependent sounds.

Sounds applied to objects such as parachutes use the sound type to calculate a sound's pitch and volume based on the angle and velocity.

Properties such as Mass and pitch and yaw angles are used to determine how to manipulate the sound.

Fields:

Mass - float value - Mass - Mass of object //kg?
YawAngle - float value - Angle of yaw in degrees.
PitchAngle - float value - Angle of pitch in degrees.

Example:

"crane_strain_test_vb_kinetic" tells the child sound that the entity has a Mass of 100, and a PitchAngle of 180.

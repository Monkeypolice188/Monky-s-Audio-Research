The RandomizedSound (_rnd, _rdm, _rand, _random, _randomize) type can be used to pick any child sound from a list of sounds.

It contains a list of Variations and their names (as "keys") and the value of its probability.

The randomizer can be limited using the HistoryIndex value and HistorySpace Flags, which will limit the chosen Variations to the count.

Fields:

HistoryIndex - Unused. Restricts the randomization to a specified offset. (default 0 = no limit, 2 = first two Variations (FF FF) only, 3 = first three Variations (FF FF FF) only, etc)
HistorySpace - Flags corresponding to item count. When enabled, will correspond to the HistoryIndex value (1-2 Variations = FF, 3-4 = FF FF, 5-6 = FF FF FF, etc)

Example:

"tracks" picks randomly between "track_1", "track_2" and "track_3". Both "track_1" and "track_2" have a 100% probability of being chosen, while "track_3" has a 50% probability of being chosen.

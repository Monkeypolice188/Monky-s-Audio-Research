The "ConstantCurve" is a curve type used to define a constant line which runs at a single amplitude.

The curve has fields for the min and max input on the X axis, and the value at which it should map in the Y axis.

MinInput - minimum value on the X axis of the graph
MaxOuput - maximum value on the X axis of the graph
Value - offset on the Y axis of the graph.

Example:

Below, "constant_one" has an input (X axis) range of 1 (0 to 1). The Value (Y axis) defined is 1. Therefore, this maps a constant, flat line.

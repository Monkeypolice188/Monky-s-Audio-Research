The "PiecewiseLinearCurve" is a curve type used to graph linear points.

The curve type is often used to create customized linear curves by defining turning points.

The curve has fields for the min and max input on the X axis.

MinInput - minimum value on the X axis of the graph
MaxOuput - maximum value on the X axis of the graph
Points - list of piecwise linear points on the graph

Example:

Below, "energy_decay" has an input (X axis) range of 1 (0 to 1). It has points on the graph as (0, 0), (0.001, 0), (0.5, 0.5), (1, 1).

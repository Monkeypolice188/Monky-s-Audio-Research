The "EqualPowerCurve" is a curve type used to define two curves approaching a median, before overlapping.

The curve type is used to crossfade sounds. Both curves are affected by the input values. 

The Flip value is used to flip the direction of the curves relative to the median.

The curve has fields for the min and max input on the X axis.

MinInput - minimum value on the X axis of the graph
MaxOuput - maximum value on the X axis of the graph
Flip - Flips the direction of the curves across the median.
	0 - Rise
	1 - Mid (crossfade)
	2 - Fall
	3 - Unknown //? waves_test

Example:

Below, "equal_power_rise" has an input (X axis) range of 1 (0 to 1). The Flip value is defined as 1. Therefore, this maps a rising curve graph.

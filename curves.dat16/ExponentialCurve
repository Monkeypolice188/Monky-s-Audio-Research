The "ExponentialCurve" is a curve type used to graph exponential growth of a sound.

The curve type is often used in place of the LinearCurve to create exponential gain.


The curve has fields for the min and max input on the X axis.

MinInput - minimum value on the X axis of the graph
MaxOuput - maximum value on the X axis of the graph
Flip - Unknown //?
Exponent - the exponential rate of the graph.

Example:

Below, "melee_swipe_velocity_to_volume" has an input (X axis) range of 1 (0 to 1). The Flip value is defined as 0, and the Exponent is 5.

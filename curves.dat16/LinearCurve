The "LinearCurve" is a curve type used to define a constant line which can map at any particular angle.

The curve has fields for the min and max input on both the X and Y axis of the graph.

MinInput - minimum value on the X axis of the graph
MaxOuput - maximum value on the X axis of the graph
Unk03/Unk04 - minimum value on the Y axis of the graph.
Unk05/Unk06 - maximum value on the Y axis of the graph.

Example:

Below, "linear_rise" has an input (X axis) range of 1 (0 to 1). The minimum Y axis value is defined as 0, and the max defined as 1.
Therefore, this graph maps as a diagonal line from 0 to 1.

The VehicleScannerParams type is used by the police scanner to identify a vehicle.

It is used to assign a manufacturer, model, category and colour to a vehicle. 

The police scanner will refer to a vehicle by its current color so long as the Unk04 entry is blank, or the vehicle does not have FLAG_HAS_LIVERY in vehicles.meta

The police scanner will pair up either the manufacturer or color override with either the model or the category entries.

Fields:

Name - metahash - scannerparams name //from Dat151Vehicle ScannerParams
Flags - flag value - Scanner flags //See Flags
Unk01 - metahash - Manufacturer //Dat54 eg brute, joebuilt, vapid
Unk02 - metahash - Model //Dat54 eg boxville, phantom, stanier
Unk03 - metahash - Category //Dat54 eg big rig, 4-door, sports, utility vehicle
Unk04 - metahash - ColorOverride - overrides the color prefix//Dat54 eg white, black, grey

Flags
The Flags value represents basic scanner flags.

The Unk00 flag reads "0xXXXXXXXX" where "X" represents the following digits in respective order:

0xAAAAAAA1 - disables the Model entry  //emergency and utility/service vehicles 
0xAAAAAAA8 - ? //all scanner params

Example:

boxville_scanner_params_white will allow the police scanner to refer to the vehicle as:
- white truck
- brute truck
- white boxville
- brute boxville

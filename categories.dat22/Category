The Category (01) type is used to assign base settings to any audio entry using one. 

A category holds several basic audio fields such as Volume, LPF and HPF cutoff, as well as distance and pan. 

Categories can also contain a number of sub-categories, which will also be affected by the parent category's settings.

As well as assigning information such as base volume, LPF and attenuation, categories are also used by mixers to change the volume/pan/etc of all audio entries using particular categories.

Category appears in sounds.dat54's Header section, as well as in various types within game.dat151 and dynamix.dat15.

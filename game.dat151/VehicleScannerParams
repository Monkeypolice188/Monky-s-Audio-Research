The VehicleScannerParams (76) type is used by the police scanner to identify a vehicle.

It is used to assign a manufacturer, model, category and colour to a vehicle. 

The police scanner will refer to a vehicle by its current color so long as the ColorOverride entry is blank, or the vehicle does not have FLAG_HAS_LIVERY in vehicles.meta

The police scanner will pair up either the manufacturer or color override with either the model or the category entries.

- white truck
- brute truck
- white boxville
- brute boxville
